# Diabetes_Detection
Created a diabetes detection ML model using simple  linear-SVM and Logistic Regression and comparison between them

This Project contains
  -- PIMA diabetes dataset
  -- Support vector machines (SVMs)
  -- Logistic Regression 
  -- Comparsion between the test size and the acccuracy of the ML models
  -- Scaling of the data
